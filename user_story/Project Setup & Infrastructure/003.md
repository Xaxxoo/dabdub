As a DevOps engineer
I want a secure and validated configuration management system
So that sensitive credentials are protected and environment-specific settings are properly managed
Acceptance Criteria:

Application fails to start with clear error messages when required env vars are missing
Configuration is properly typed and injectable across all modules
Production secrets are managed through AWS Secrets Manager or Vault
No sensitive data is ever committed to the repository
