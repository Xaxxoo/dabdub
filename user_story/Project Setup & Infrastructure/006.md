As a user
I want to securely authenticate using JWT tokens
So that my account is protected and I can access my wallet
Acceptance Criteria:

Users can register and login successfully
JWT tokens are properly validated on protected routes
Refresh token rotation works without interrupting user sessions
Logout invalidates tokens and prevents further access
