As a developer
I want Redis integrated for caching, session management, and job queues
So that the application can handle background tasks and improve performance through caching
Acceptance Criteria:

Redis connection is established on application startup
Cache interceptor reduces repeated database queries
Bull queues are operational for background jobs
Redis health check returns accurate connection status
