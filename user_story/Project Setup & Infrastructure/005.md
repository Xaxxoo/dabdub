As a developer
I want comprehensive logging and centralized error handling
So that I can debug issues quickly and monitor application health
Acceptance Criteria:

All errors are caught and logged with appropriate context
Correlation IDs trace requests through the entire system
Errors are automatically reported to Sentry
Logs are structured and searchable in the logging system
